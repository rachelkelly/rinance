#open moneyfile read/write
#envelopes = {}
#for line in moneyfile:
#   make dict, keys are things-to-pay & values are $$ designated
#   each thing-to-pay
#   print things-to-pay
#
#then "what is incoming amount"
if amount > 1500:
	#maybe my arithm is dumb
	in_rent = amount-(amount-525)
	now take it away from the amount:
	amount = amount - in_rent
	static_rent = static_rent + in_rent
	in_sprint = amount-(amount-200)
